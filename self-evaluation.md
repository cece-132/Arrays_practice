How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
*It's fine I am still kind of confused. But I think I got the right answer so that's all that matters.*

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
*No, I don't really have time to ponder all the possibilities of array. I am sure that I will gain further understanding in the next lesson. Plus hoping i pass mod 0 I will review everything again next week. This weekend I will definitely be looking over all the notes I took*

What questions do you have about Arrays?
*- What is the application of calling through the 4 methods on the arrays?*
