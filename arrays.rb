# Arrays Practice

names = ["Jim", "Slay", "Switch", "Ben"]
# prints the last element in the array
puts names.pop

ages = [18, 37, 78, 21]
# prints all the elements
puts ages.push

heights = [72.5, 85.6, 65.8, 92.3]
# pulls the first element height
puts heights.shift

verified_heights = [true, false, true, true]
# prints the elements
puts verified_heights.unshift

# Ruby Documentation
## in ruby i can use different commands to access the elements or to create new ones
## the benefits of using irb is that I am using a safe space to test my code one line at a time so that I am not typing in huge projects that end up being littered with unworkable code.
